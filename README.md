# Pandas_1
I've continued my Python/Pandas journey by learning data preparation and EDA. I've used titanic dataset and crosstab() function to cross-examination for any two columns. I've used groupby() and agg() function to group columns' values by aggregating based on another column just like Group By Key in SQL. We can use isnull() and sum() methods altogether to see whether any columns have null values. Also we can use count(), sum() etc for mathematical and statistical operations.

A column may have different values. We might want to see how many values this column has. Especially for categorical columns. So, We can use value_counts() method to see or we can see value_counts() and .shape[0] altogether to see as percentage and I think we should separate numerical and categorical columns each other that can be found altogether in df.columns. 

We can use .dtypes and info() to see dataset's columns' types and whether they have null values.
